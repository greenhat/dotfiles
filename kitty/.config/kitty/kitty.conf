cursor_shape beam
#: The cursor shape can be one of (block, beam, underline)

cursor_beam_thickness 1.5
#: Defines the thickness of the beam cursor (in pts)

scrollback_pager nvim -c 'set nonumber nolist showtabline=0 foldcolumn=0' -c 'set ft=man' -c 'normal G' -
#: Program with which to view scrollback in a new window. The
#: scrollback buffer is passed as STDIN to this program. If you change
#: it, make sure the program you use can handle ANSI escape sequences
#: for colors and text formatting. INPUT_LINE_NUMBER in the command
#: line above will be replaced by an integer representing which line
#: should be at the top of the screen.

scrollback_pager_history_size 10
#: Separate scrollback history size, used only for browsing the
#: scrollback buffer (in MB). This separate buffer is not available
#: for interactive scrolling but will be piped to the pager program
#: when viewing scrollback buffer in a separate window. The current
#: implementation stores one character in 4 bytes, so approximatively
#: 2500 lines per megabyte at 100 chars per line. A value of zero or
#: less disables this feature. The maximum allowed size is 4GB.

input_delay 0
#: Delay (in milliseconds) before input from the program running in
#: the terminal is processed. Note that decreasing it will increase
#: responsiveness, but also increase CPU usage and might cause flicker
#: in full screen programs that redraw the entire screen on each loop,
#: because kitty is so fast that partial screen updates will be drawn.

repaint_delay 0
# Delay between screen updates (in milliseconds). Decreasing it, increases 
# frames-per-second (FPS) at the cost of more CPU usage. The default value 
# yields ~100 FPS which is more than sufficient for most uses. Note that to 
# actually achieve 100 FPS, you have to either set sync_to_monitor to no or 
# use a monitor with a high refresh rate. Also, to minimize latency when 
# there is pending input to be processed, this option is ignored.

sync_to_monitor no
#: Sync screen updates to the refresh rate of the monitor. This
#: prevents tearing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing)
#: when scrolling. However, it limits the rendering speed to the
#: refresh rate of your monitor. With a very high speed mouse/high
#: keyboard repeat rate, you may notice some slight input latency. If
#: so, set this to no.

macos_option_as_alt yes
#: Use the option key as an alt key. With this set to no, kitty will
#: use the macOS native Option+Key = unicode character behavior. This
#: will break any Alt+key keyboard shortcuts in your terminal
#: programs, but you can use the macOS unicode input technique. You
#: can use the values: left, right, or both to use only the left,
#: right or both Option keys as Alt, instead.

macos_quit_when_last_window_closed yes
#: Have kitty quit when all the top-level windows are closed. By
#: default, kitty will stay running, even with no open windows, as is
#: the expected behavior on macOS.

linux_display_server wayland
#: Choose between Wayland and X11 backends. By default, an appropriate
#: backend based on the system state is chosen automatically. Set it
#: to x11 or wayland to force the choice.
