# Editing tools

Always use diff editing tool `str_replace` instead of writing the whole file.

# Shell tools

Prefer `rg` instead of `grep`.
Use `gh` cli tool to access github.com (view issues, PRs, etc.).

# Coding best practices

Use TDD.
First, write tests based on expected input/output pairs. Don't use mocks.
Second, run tests and confirm they fail. Don't write any implementation code.
Third, write the implementation code that passes the tests.

Do not disable tests, overfit them or change tests to make them always pass.

After finishing the implementation (code changes) always build the project and fix the compilation errors.
