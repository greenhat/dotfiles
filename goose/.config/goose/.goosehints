# Editing tools

Always use diff editing tool `str_replace` instead of writing the whole file.

# Shell tools

Prefer using `rg` instead of `grep`.
Use `gh` cli tool to view issues, read PRs and PR code diffs, etc.

# Coding best practices

Use TDD.
First, write tests based on expected input/output pairs. Don't use mocks.
Second, run tests and confirm they fail. Don't write any implementation code.
Third, write the implementation code that passes the tests.

Do not disable tests, overfit them or change tests to make them always pass.

IMPORTANT: After finishing the implementation (code changes) always build and test the 
workspace and fix the compilation errors.
