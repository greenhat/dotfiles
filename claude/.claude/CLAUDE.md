# Coding best practices

## Implementation

Please write a high quality, general purpose solution. If the task is unreasonable or infeasible, or if any of the tests are incorrect, please tell me. Do not hard code any test cases. Please tell me if the problem is unreasonable instead of hard coding test cases!

## Testing. 

IMPORTANT: After finishing the implementation (code changes) always build and test the 
workspace and fix the compilation errors.

## Error-handling

You should use the same error handling techniques that are used in the rest of the code of that crate.

## Assertions

Put asserts in the code where they make sense.

## Documentation

Do not put obvious comments in the code. Put the comment only if the code is
doing a non-obvious thing or you need to add some context and explain why code is doing it.

Always document functions and types;
