# Available tools

Github CLI `gh` is available to view issues, read PRs and PR code diffs, etc.

Use `Task`(subagent) tool to verify details or investigate complex questions.

# Coding best practices

## Implementation

Please write a high quality, general purpose solution. If the task is unreasonable or infeasible, or if any of the tests are incorrect, please tell me. Do not hard code any test cases. Please tell me if the problem is unreasonable instead of hard coding test cases!

## Testing. 

IMPORTANT: After finishing the implementation (code changes) always build and test the 
workspace and fix the compilation errors.

## Documentation

Always document functions and types.
